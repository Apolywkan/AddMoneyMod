# AddMoneyMod

Tired of working for your money? Want to enjoy the finer things offered by the store but can't bring yourself to spend credits on them? AddMoneyMod provides a simple way to add credits through the terminal so as not to break immersion. 

## Installation

Use the Thunderstore mod loader (recommended)                                     
Otherwise, for manual installation, locate your lethal company folder then navigate as follows:     
Lethal Company > BepInEx > plugins                      
Place the mod folder in here and run your game.

This mod requires [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) and [TerminalApi](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/NotAtomicBomb/TerminalApi/) to run
